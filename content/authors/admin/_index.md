**What is the idea?**  
The ManyBeds project is a large-scale replication study of Rudoy et al. (2009), investigating the Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) effect. TMR is a technique used to selectively cue memories during sleep and is thought to induce memory replay which is criticial for memory consolidation (Feld & Born, 2017; see Hu et al. (2020) for a meta-analysis of TMR).

In a collaborative effort, EEG and behavioral data of 600 participants will be collected and analyzed at mutliple lab sites, providing a precise estimate of the TMR effect and novel insights into the robustness of analyses in memory and sleep research using a split-half dataset approach. The outcome of the replication will be tested in a many analysts approach, using preregistrations and round robin feedback between participating analysis teams. Analyses will be conducted on half the dataset, allowing to assess the robustness of chosen analysis paths on the withheld dataset. Additionally, having such a large, highly powered dataset allows for further exploratory analyses.

The ManyBeds project is a Big Team Science study (Baumgartner et al., 2023; Coles et al., 2022), utilizing multi-site data collection (Pavlov et al., 2021), a many analysts approach (Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020) including round-robin feedback (Silberzahn et al., 2018; Hoogeven et al., 2022) and methods of open, transparent science practices (Gilmore et al., 2017; Koch & Jones, 2016).
