        In the ManyBeds project, sleep labs will collect behavioral and sleep-EEG data using acoustically cued TMR similar to Rudoy et al. (2009). To assess replicability and robustness of findings in sleep research, the data will be analyzed using a many analysts approach. Find out more about how to contribute to the data analysis of ManyBeds here. 
        
        **Who can participate?**  
        Analysis teams (1–3 researchers) need to have experience with analyzing behavioural and EEG data and can consist of PhD candidates up to PIs. We recommend having one experienced PostDoc and/or PI in each team.
        
        **What is required for participation?**  
        Analysis teams need to adhere to the given timeframe of the project. That is, teams need to reserve some time (i.e., 3 months time frame) at the beginning of the project to plan their analyses (expected Autumn 2024). Upon start of the data collection, analysis teams will receive a small, label-shuffled subset of the data to refine their analyses and already work on setting up an analysis script (expected Summer 2025). Then, teams need to provide feedback on the planned analysis of a different analysis team. Lastly, teams need to preregister their planned analyses. After data completion, teams receive access and have 3 months to conduct their planned analyses, fill out a standardized report form, and submit their reproducible analysis script (expected Spring 2026). 
        
        **What do we provide?**  
        We provide the hypotheses to be tested, organization of the round robin feedback, manage the dataset to be collected and provide access, as well as a custom preregistration template. Further, we have a small amount of funding available for research assistants to support labs that have little own funding. 
        
        **What do we offer?** 
        Next to being part of an innovative large scale research project on memory and sleep, we offer all contributors (data-collecting labs and analysis teams) co-authorship on the replication manuscript. Data-collecting labs will also be offered co-authorship on the dataset publication. It is possible to take part in both data collection and analysis track.
        
        **Hypotheses**  
        Analysis teams will plan their analyses and report their results with regard to the following hypotheses. Results will be submitted using a standardized template including binary decisions, key statistical parameters, and standardized effect sizes.
        Subject to specification / preliminary
