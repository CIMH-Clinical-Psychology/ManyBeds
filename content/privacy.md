**What are personal data?**

Personal data are all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. The key factor is whether the data collected can be linked to a person. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, user behavior. Information that cannot be directly associated with your actual identity – such as favorite websites or the number of users of a page – are not personal data.

**How do we collect and process data about you when you visit our website?**

When you use our website purely for informational purposes, i.e., if you do not register or otherwise provide us with information, we do not collect any data. 

**How do we use your data and share it?**

If there is an opportunity within the internet offer to enter personal or business data (email addresses, names, addresses), the user provides this data explicitly on a voluntary basis. Emails are transmitted via a contact form. If you send us such a message, your personal data will be collected only to the extent necessary to respond. The email is transmitted unencrypted. We use the personal data you provide solely for the purpose of technical administration of the websites and to fulfill your wishes and requirements, i.e., generally to process the contract concluded with you or to respond to your inquiry. Only if you have given us your prior consent, or if you – as far as statutory provisions foresee – have not objected, do we also use this data for product-related surveys, marketing purposes, and statistical purposes. Your personal data will not be passed on, sold, or otherwise transmitted to third parties, unless this is necessary for the purpose of contract processing or you have explicitly consented to it. Consent given can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.

If we rely on contracted service providers for individual functions of our offer or wish to use your data for advertising purposes, we will inform you in detail about the respective processes below. We will also specify the set criteria for the storage duration.

**How long are your data stored?**

We generally store all information you transmit to us until the respective purpose is fulfilled. For example, inquiries until they are completed, newsletters until you unsubscribe. If a longer storage period is required by law, the storage is carried out within this framework.

**When are your data deleted?**

The data collected in this context will be deleted after storage is no longer necessary or processing is restricted if there are legal retention obligations. The deletion of stored personal data also occurs if you revoke your consent to storage, if the knowledge of the data is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose pursued with the storage, or if storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons. Data for billing purposes and accounting purposes are not affected by a deletion request.

You have the following rights regarding the personal data concerning you:

- Right to access,
- Right to rectification or deletion,
- Right to restriction of processing,
- Right to object to processing,
- Right to data portability.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data.

**Electronic Mails (Emails)**

When transmitting personal data by email, we point out that the internet itself does not provide protection mechanisms and thus access by third parties cannot be generally excluded. The data transmitted to us will be used exclusively for the purposes specified to us, treated confidentially, and deleted immediately after processing your request. No data will be passed on to third parties.


**What do we do for the security of processing**

Our institute takes all necessary technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from loss and misuse. For example, your data is stored in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to the public. In certain cases, your personal data is encrypted during transmission using so-called Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL). This means that communication between your computer and the servers of our institute takes place using a recognized encryption procedure if your browser supports SSL.

**Your Data Protection Rights**

You have the right to free information at any time within the scope of the applicable legal provisions about your stored personal data, their origin, and possible recipients, and the purpose of the data processing (Article 15 GDPR), and, if applicable, a right to rectification of incorrect data (Article 16 GDPR), deletion of these data (Article 17 GDPR), the right to restriction of processing according to Article 18 GDPR, to object (Article 21 GDPR), and the right to data portability of data you provided according to Article 20 GDPR. The restrictions under Sections 9 and 10 of the Data Protection Act of Baden-Württemberg apply to the right of access and deletion.

In addition, in the event of data protection violations, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (Article 77 GDPR in conjunction with Section 25 of the Data Protection Act of Baden-Württemberg). The competent supervisory authority in data protection matters is the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of the State of Baden-Württemberg, P.O. Box 10 29 32, 70025 Stuttgart, Tel.: 0711 615541-0, Fax: 0711 615541-15, Email: [poststelle@lfdi.bwl.de](mailto:poststelle@lfdi.bwl.de).

**How to Revoke Consents Given for Data Processing**

Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent already given at any time. A simple email to [datenschutzbeauftragter@zi-mannheim.de](mailto:datenschutzbeauftragter@zi-mannheim.de) is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the point of revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
