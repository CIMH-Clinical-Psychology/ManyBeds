        In the ManyBeds project, sleep labs will collect behavioral and sleep-EEG data using acoustically cued TMR similar to Rudoy et al. (2009). Find out more about how to contribute to the data collection of ManyBeds here.  
        
        **Who can participate?**  
        Sleep labs with experience in conducting TMR and sleep studies as well as monitoring and scoring sleep EEG online are cordially invited to apply to be one of the 10 data-collecting lab sites. Labs can apply as a team of up to 3 researchers, of whom one needs to be a PI or postdoctoral researcher with the required expertise. Labs need to specify the team member(s) running the experiments and describe their expertise. 
       
        **What is required for participation?**  
        Data-collecting labs need to collect data of 60 healthy participants (30 sleep condition, 30 wake condition; both after exclusion), aged 18 – 40 years, over the course of 12-18 months. Data collection is expected to start at the beginning of January 2025. The main part of the experiment includes an afternoon nap and takes approximately 3 hours. In addition, participants need to take an adaptation nap approximately 1 week prior to the main experiment (1,5 h). Labs need to have access to a sleep lab including a bed, audio setup next to the bed, and computer setup including audio with a screen diagonal of at least 50cm/20in. At the moment, we do not impose requirements for the EEG setup. 
        
        We provide materials (instructions and experiment) in English and German. Other languages need to be translated by the participating labs. We obtained ethical approval at the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany, but depending on your institution, you may have to additionally seek approval by your institution’s IRB. Moreover, as a quality check, researchers of the data-collecting labs running the experiment will each be asked to score sleep EEGs of the other participating labs. 
        
        **What do we provide?**
        We provide the experimental paradigm via jsPsych and on-site support in implementing the procedure in your lab. We will further provide training materials for online sleep scoring and for the data collection procedure in general. Additionally, we have funding available to cover participant reimbursement and consumables, as well as funding for research assistants to assist in data collection. 
        
        **What do we offer?**  
        Next to being part of an innovative large scale research project on memory and sleep, we offer all contributors (data-collecting labs and analysis teams) co-authorship on the replication manuscript. Data-collecting labs will also be offered co-authorship on the dataset publication. In addition, we offer early access to the confirmation dataset prior to data sharing, allowing for exploration and possible additional publications. It is possible to take part in both data collection and analysis track.

        *Application for the data collection track closed on 31<sup>st</sup> of August 2024.*  
        However, registration for the analysis track is still possible <u>[here](https://redcap.link/ManyBeds)</u>.
