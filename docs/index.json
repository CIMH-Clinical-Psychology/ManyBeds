(2009), investigating the Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) effect. TMR is a technique used to selectively cue memories during sleep and is thought to induce memory replay which is criticial for memory consolidation (Feld \u0026amp; Born, 2017; see Hu et al. (2020) for a meta-analysis of TMR).\nIn a collaborative effort, EEG and behavioral data of 600 participants will be collected and analyzed at mutliple lab sites, providing a precise estimate of the TMR effect and novel insights into the robustness of analyses in memory and sleep research using a split-half dataset approach. The outcome of the replication will be tested in a many analysts approach, using preregistrations and round robin feedback between participating analysis teams. Analyses will be conducted on half the dataset, allowing to assess the robustness of chosen analysis paths on the withheld dataset. Additionally, having such a large, highly powered dataset allows for further exploratory analyses.\nThe ManyBeds project is a Big Team Science study (Baumgartner et al., 2023; Coles et al., 2022), utilizing multi-site data collection (Pavlov et al., 2021), a many analysts approach (Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020) including round-robin feedback (Silberzahn et al., 2018; Hoogeven et al., 2022) and methods of open, transparent science practices (Gilmore et al., 2017; Koch \u0026amp; Jones, 2016).\nCheck out the recording of our information event to learn more!\nHere is the link to the recording, the password to access the file is ManyBeds1234 .\nThe slides you can find here.\nYou already know you want to be a part of ManyBeds?\nSign up here!

The key factor is whether the data collected can be linked to a person. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, user behavior. Information that cannot be directly associated with your actual identity – such as favorite websites or the number of users of a page – are not personal data.\nHow do we collect and process data about you when you visit our website?\nWhen you use our website purely for informational purposes, i.e., if you do not register or otherwise provide us with information, we do not collect any data.\nHow do we use your data and share it?\nIf there is an opportunity within the internet offer to enter personal or business data (email addresses, names, addresses), the user provides this data explicitly on a voluntary basis. Emails are transmitted via a contact form. If you send us such a message, your personal data will be collected only to the extent necessary to respond. The email is transmitted unencrypted. We use the personal data you provide solely for the purpose of technical administration of the websites and to fulfill your wishes and requirements, i.e., generally to process the contract concluded with you or to respond to your inquiry. Only if you have given us your prior consent, or if you – as far as statutory provisions foresee – have not objected, do we also use this data for product-related surveys, marketing purposes, and statistical purposes. Your personal data will not be passed on, sold, or otherwise transmitted to third parties, unless this is necessary for the purpose of contract processing or you have explicitly consented to it. Consent given can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.\nIf we rely on contracted service providers for individual functions of our offer or wish to use your data for advertising purposes, we will inform you in detail about the respective processes below. We will also specify the set criteria for the storage duration.\nHow long are your data stored?\nWe generally store all information you transmit to us until the respective purpose is fulfilled. For example, inquiries until they are completed, newsletters until you unsubscribe. If a longer storage period is required by law, the storage is carried out within this framework.\nWhen are your data deleted?\nThe data collected in this context will be deleted after storage is no longer necessary or processing is restricted if there are legal retention obligations. The deletion of stored personal data also occurs if you revoke your consent to storage, if the knowledge of the data is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose pursued with the storage, or if storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons. Data for billing purposes and accounting purposes are not affected by a deletion request.\nYou have the following rights regarding the personal data concerning you:\nRight to access, Right to rectification or deletion, Right to restriction of processing, Right to object to processing, Right to data portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data.\nElectronic Mails (Emails)\nWhen transmitting personal data by email, we point out that the internet itself does not provide protection mechanisms and thus access by third parties cannot be generally excluded. The data transmitted to us will be used exclusively for the purposes specified to us, treated confidentially, and deleted immediately after processing your request. No data will be passed on to third parties.\nWhat do we do for the security of processing\nOur institute takes all necessary technical and organizational security measures to protect …","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/ManyBeds/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/ManyBeds/privacy/","section":"","summary":"Data Protection\nAs of: 15.07.2022\nThis declaration provides an overview of how personal data is collected and processed when using our websites and what you can do to better protect your data.","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"}]
